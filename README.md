Just an email I got from Andrew Sowa about the wonderful SK6812 RGBY / RGBA LEDs I got from Phil at SZLCOE <phil@szlcoe.com>.

They are amazing because they have a dedicated yellow channel which fixes a serious problem with when normal RGB leds attempt to display yellow, instead they get a somewhat sickly color.

"I was able to do some quick testing the on the RGBY leds I bought.  CRI is in the low 70's, I need to double check the power draw because there is some odd behavior.  The Blue peak is high when RGB are max but the Red and Yellow are high when RGBY are max.

When I get more time I will map out at the black body curve. I would like to automate the testing of all the combinations but that will probably crash the excel sheet if I do it all at once."
